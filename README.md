# Code-Library
Low-level drivers, utilities, examples, and project outlines for microcontrollers.  The goal is that applications written using these files should work across multiple platforms.

Organization is by folder:
* Examples - projects using the library, used for demo and testing.
* External Peripherals - code to control hardware other than a microcontroller (i.e. external chips).
* Processor Peripherals - drivers for microcontroller peripherals.
* Project - generic top-level files for new projects.
* Utilities - files to calculate, store, or otherwise manipulate data.
