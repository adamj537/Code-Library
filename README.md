# Code-Library
Low-level drivers, utilities, examples, and project outlines for microcontrollers

Organization is by four top-level folders:
* Project - main files for a project
* Processors - drivers for microcontroller peripherals
* Utilities - files to calculate, store, or otherwise manipulate data
* Drivers - code to control hardware other than a microcontroller
